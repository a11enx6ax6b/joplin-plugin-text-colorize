# Joplin Plugin - Text Colorize
Easily apply color to text.

‼️ Q: **Why doesn't my text save its color?**

‼️ A: **You're probably using the Rich Text Editor and this is a limitation of it. Markdown format and HTML formatting cannot be converted from Rich Text to Markdown. Consider using the Markdown Editor.** (More about the limitations of Rich Text [here](https://joplinapp.org/rich_text_editor/))
