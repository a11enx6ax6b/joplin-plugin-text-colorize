# Joplin Plugin - Text Colorize
ðŸ›‘ **Issue with Rich Text Formatting, i.e., "Why isn't my text retaining its color?"** ðŸ›‘ - This issue stems from the limitations of the Rich Text Editor. Markdown format and HTML formatting cannot be converted from Rich Text to Markdown. Consider using the Markdown Editor. (For further information on Rich Text limitations, refer [here](https://joplinapp.org/rich_text_editor/))
